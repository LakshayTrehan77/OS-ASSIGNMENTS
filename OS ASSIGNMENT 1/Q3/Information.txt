In this part of the assignment, we have to create a bash script code, intended to perform some operations (XOR, Multuply and Compare).
The Bash script creates a "Result" directory if it doesn't exist.
It reads lines from "input.txt," breaking them up into elements of an array "arr".
The data in the "input.txt" is in the format number1 number2 operation (say: 2 3 xor), which is interpret as performing the operation with the two numbers written after the numbers (xor in this case).
It determines the XOR, product of numbers orÂ makes comparisons, depending on the operations specified in the "input.txt" file.
The output/result of the operations is stored in a text file, "output.txt", created through the bash script only, in the directory "Result".
When using "compare," it establishes whether two numbers are equal and, if not, which is larger.
For each line, this process is repeated, producing output based on the given operations.
The script makes sure that operations are handled in a systematic manner, sending the results to the right output file.
