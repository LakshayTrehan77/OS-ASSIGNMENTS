Program Description:

The given C program demonstrates the use of processes with the fork() system call to create a parent and child process. The child process calculates the factorial of 4, while the parent process generates the first 16 numbers of the Fibonacci series.

Program Flow:

Necessary header files are included, such as stdio.h, stdlib.h, sys/types.h, sys/wait.h, and unistd.h, providing access to standard I/O functions, system types, process control functions, and UNIX-specific functions.

The factorial(int n) function calculates the factorial of a given integer n using recursion. If n is less than or equal to 1, it returns 1. Otherwise, it returns n * factorial(n - 1).

The fibonacci(int n) function generates the Fibonacci series up to the n-th term. It initializes two variables a and b to 0 and 1, respectively. The loop runs n times, printing the value of a (the current Fibonacci number). Then, it updates a and b by assigning the value of b to a and the sum of a and b to b.

The executeParentChild(int ptr) function is called from the main() function with an argument of 0. This function demonstrates the use of fork() to create a child process.

Inside executeParentChild(), the program forks using fork(). This creates a child process. If fork() fails, an error message is printed, and the program exits.

In the child process (if fork() succeeds and returns 0), the factorial of 4 is calculated using the factorial() function. The result is then printed as "Child Process: Factorial of 4 is 24". The child process immediately exits using _exit() to prevent any conflicts with the parent process's memory.

In the parent process (if fork() returns a positive value representing the child's PID), the fibonacci() function is called with an argument of 16. This prints the first 16 Fibonacci numbers.

After printing the Fibonacci series, the parent process waits for the child process to finish using the wait(NULL) function. This ensures that the parent process doesn't terminate before the child process completes.

The main() function calls executeParentChild(0) to initiate the execution of the executeParentChild() function.

Summary:

In summary, the program uses fork() to create a child process. The child calculates the factorial of 4, while the parent generates the first 16 Fibonacci numbers. The parent process waits for the child to complete before finishing its execution. This program illustrates the fundamental concept of processes, their creation using fork(), and basic interprocess communication.
